Hi there, I'm Alex 👋🏽
</h3>

<h2 align="center">Full-Stack Developer 💻 —— Fitness Coach 🏋🏽‍♂️ —— Martial Arts Instructor 🥋</h2>

I believe in constant never-ending improvement physically, mentally, and spiritually. And I achieve this through physical training, coding and reading, and practicing Filipino martial arts.

I truly enjoy the process of identifying problems and creating solutions.
